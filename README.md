# React + Rails Trip Planning App

A remake of my final project (wander) for Lighthouse Labs, an app that allows users to collaborate when planning a trip together.

## Running the app

You need **TWO** terminals for this.

In one terminal, run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `client`. Then run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
